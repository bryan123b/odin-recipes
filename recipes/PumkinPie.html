<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A traditional pumpkin pie serving 8 people</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>gingersnap cookies</li>
  <li>dark brown sugar</li>
  <li>ground ginger</li>
  <li>unsalted butter, melted</li>
  <li>can pumpkin puree</li>
  <li>half and half</li>
  <li>freshly grated nutmeg</li>
  <li>kosher salt</li>
  <li>large eggs</li>
  <li>large egg yolk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Heat the oven to 350ºF</li>
  <li>
    Make the crust: Combine the gingersnaps, brown sugar, and ginger in a food
    processor. Process until the cookies are fine crumbs. Drizzle the butter
    into the crumb mixture. Pulse 8 to 10 times to combine.
  </li>
  <li>
    Press the gingersnap mixture into the bottom, up the sides, and just over
    the lip of a 9-inch glass pie dish. Place on a half-sheet pan and bake until
    lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool the crust at least 10 minutes before
    filling.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bring the pumpkin puree to a simmer over medium heat in a 2-quart saucepan.
    Cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly
    thickened. Add the half-and-half, nutmeg, and salt. Stir and return the
    mixture to a simmer. Remove from the heat and cool for 10 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whisk the brown sugar, eggs, and egg yolk in a large bowl until smooth. Add
    the pumpkin mixture and whisk until thoroughly combined. Pour the filling
    into the warm pie crust and bake on the same half-sheet pan until the center
    jiggles slightly but the sides of the filling are set, 45 to 50 minutes.
    Cool on a cooling rack for at least 2 hours before slicing. The pie can be
    made and refrigerated up to 2 days in advance — it's best the day after it
    is made.
  </li>
  <li>
    Evenly divide the crust mixture among 5 (5-inch) pie tins and bake on a
    half-sheet pan for 5 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Divide the filling evenly among the pans. Bake on the same half-sheet pan
    until the center juggles slightly but the sides of the filling are set,
    about 25 minutes. Cool on a cooling rack for 2 hours.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spread 1 teaspoon of the brown sugar on the top of each pie. Melt the sugar
    using a blowtorch to form a crisp top. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.
  </li>
</ol>
